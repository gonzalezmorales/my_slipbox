It aims to establish a social order that is not built on the basis of irrational dogma, but at the same time, allows for a minimum of stability and order necessary for the preservation and functioning of the state.</data>

      <data key="d1">In human history, as in the history of philosophy, the pursuit of individual freedom has been always in conflict with the quest for social cohesion 

- In ancient Greece, social bonds where established, in varying degrees, through the loyalty and duties _of citizens_ towards the state. 
- After the Greeks where conquered by Rome, a more individualistic ethic emerged (e.g., the stoics identified virtue not so much in the relationship between citizens and the State, but between the soul and God).  
- With Christianity, the idea became more widespread that an individual's duties towards God take precedence over those towards the state. 
- Liberalism provided for a clear separation between the public and the private spheres.  
- This separation let, on one hand. to romanticism and individualism, and on the other to doctrines centered around the glorification of the state.</data>

      <data key="d1">Philosophy combines both scientific and ethical/religious points of view.  

It sits between science (knowledge) and theology (dogma).  On the one hand, it appeals to reason instead of authority or tradition; on the other, its speculates about things that are not know (or even knowable) with certainty.  

Philosophy asks questions that science cannot answer (at least not yet). But is does not accept the (unquestionable) answers provided by theology.</data>

- People's behavior is at least in part determined by their notions of good and evil. 
- "To understand an era or a people, one has to understand their philosophy."
- There is a two-way causality between human history and the history of philosophy; similarly, one's life situation determines one's own philosophy, and vice-versa.

Personal perspective:

- Philosophy tries to teach us how to live without being paralyzed by the absence of certainty.</data>

- With the rise of Christianity and the **end of the Roman empire**, philosophy merged back into theology 
- Philosophy's second "big era" between the **11th and 14th centuries** under the rule of the catholic church, and ended with the Reformation.

The established philosophy of this era played a key role in this, since although  the secular centers of power kept the monopoly of violence and were not bound by a notion of legality, the authority of kings and barons of germanic descent was dependent on the loyalty and support of their feudal aristocracies, while the church had the monopoly on education and, more importantly, was believed to have the keys to everyone's eternal salvation or damnation.</data>

      <data key="d1">The Renaissance and the Reformation destroyed the unity of Christianity around the pope's authority.
- New knowledge about antique cultures became more widespread
- Copernicus' astronomy gave Man and the Earth a different place in philosophy
- The belief in eternal regularity was replaced by scientific inquiry, subjectivism and moral relativism
- With Machiavelli, politics was understood as the naked pursuit of power.
- The Reformation was a revolt of the Nordic kings and peoples against the pope's dominance.
- The authority of the pope was countervailed not by one secular emperor, but by a multitude of nation states (and the strengthening of social bonds within them)
- In the new protestant philosophy, there is no longer a single earthly intermediary between the soul and God
- The truth does not come from an authority, but is grasped by each individual through reason
- This lead to the advent of anarchism, mysticism. 
- There is no one protestant philosophy, but as many philosophies as there are philosophers.
- Slowly, the seeds are planted for a re-emergence of individualism and pluralism.</data>

      <data key="d0">Geo-spatial disaggregation</data>
      <data key="d1">The geographic scale at which data are disaggregated affects the type of information that can be derived from it.  

Data collected at more granular level of geographic detail often provide more useful information about patterns of geographic variation and correlation, and can be more flexibly aggregated into broader geographic areas suitable for different types of analysis.

Examples of geographic scales:

- Administrative unit (level 0, level 1, level 2...)
- Populated place
- Point location
- Grid location
- Area/Line features

Defining a minimum level of geospatial disaggregation facilitates data integration and analysis.  Such minimum level of geospatial disaggregation should be established considering factors such as:

- **Analytic objectives** (e.g., informing policies or decisions at national or local levels)
- **Country context** (e.g., how large are the different levels of administrative units)
- Expected **variability** within and across different units at each level of disaggregation (e.g., too much variability within units / too little variability between units may require more granular disaggregation)
- Type of **data collection process** (e.g., earth observation, on-site measurements, or administrative/business records). 
- Potential **privacy** implications (e.g., whether combining data at a specific level of geographic disaggregation with other datasets could lead to re-identification of personal or individual-level information)
- **Resources** (e.g., expertise and technology required to collect, process, and analyze data at a specific level of geographic desaggregation).</data>

      <data key="d1">Ad-hoc cross functional teams seek to integrate skills across organizational boundaries in order to accomplish a specific goal over a limited period of time. They are often called during a critical juncture to deal with a specific problem or explore a new opportunity.

A critical success factor is having clearly defined, realistic outputs, timeline, and exit criteria for each phase of the project.  

Ad-hoc  cross functional teams are challenged by complex supervisory relationships and incentive structures, as their members formally report to different functional managers. This increases the need for **horizontal cooperation and coordination** among team members.

To  avoid turf battles and organizational power politics, the different members of an ad-hoc cross-functional team must be completely **focused on creating value to customers**.  Team members must therefore have adequate **incentives to collaborate** outside their own "home teams" in the organization.  This means that their performance needs to be measured and rewarded based on their contributions towards achieving the objectives of the cross-functional project.

Putting together the **right mix of talents** is another key ingredient for the success of a cross-functional team.  Reluctance by managers from different functional areas to get personally involved and to commit their most qualified staff to a cross functional project team often leads to poor results. On the other hand, assigning key staff members to a cross-functional project is a clear signal of the commitment by senior management to the success of the project. 

Ad-hoc cross functional teams must also have a clearly defined **"sunsetting" plan** for incorporating back people and the team outputs, innovations and learnings back into the organization's functional processes and structure when the time comes to dissolve the team.  In particular, it is important to identify opportunities for team members to take on new responsibilities based on the skills they developed while being part of the ad-hoc cross functional team.</data>

      <data key="d1">In recent years, cloud computing has become increasingly used by statistical organizations that do not have the hardware or personnel necessary to fully deploy software applications onsite, or that need to test new software tools in the context of pilot data-innovation projects.

Today, cloud computing stands out as a key element of a business continuity and disaster recovery plan for statistical organizations, particularly in the face of the disruption national and global statistical systems caused by the COVID-19 crisis. 

In order to leverage cloud computing solutions for disaster recovery and business continuity, statistical organizations require an IT architecture focused on "automating as many processes as possible in the event of disaster, ensuring that computing resources are switched over quickly to a stable backup and remain operational."

3. **Permanent notes**: Serve to develop ideas based on fleeting notes and literature notes.  Written in precise, clear, and brief full sentences. They can be understood even outside the context they were taken from.
4. **Project notes**: Are only relevant to one particular project and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished

      <data key="d0">Poverty maps production: data sources</data>
      <data key="d1">The production of small-area poverty estimates usually relies on the following two major data sources of household welfare:

1. Detailed household surveys which collect a measure of welfare (typically consumption per capita)
2. A national census or large national survey that includes a significant share of the country's population

Other data sources that may be used to approximate individual welfare (in approximately real time):

- Individual consumption of mobile phone services
- Measures of mobility (e.g., derived from mobile phone records)
- Social network metrics (e.g., derived from social media or mobile phone records)
- Financial transactions (e.g., derived from mobile phone or credit card records)</data>

Data innovation projects that seek to produce nowcasting or small-area estimates require the collaboration of multiple government agencies and partners, with multi-stakeholder, multi-disciplinary teams working together to process ans analyze different data inputs.

It is therefore crucial to establish and strengthen collaboration across different organizations towards producing a common output and achieving a shared outcome.</data>

- Monitoring - Track the progress of long running processes and alert when errors arise
- Backfilling - Ability to re-process historical data</data>

- A programming paradigm "that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions", avoiding "changing state and mutable data". 
- The output of a function depends only on the arguments passed to it
- This approach makes it easier to understand the code and to predict outputs
- Functions can be written and tested in isolation \(without having to understand external context\)
- Through immutable data and versioned logic, functional programming allows to **insulate logic changes from data changes**, thus enhancing **reproducibility of results**</data>
