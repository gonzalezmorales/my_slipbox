But although data innovation projects aim to change how statistical organizations work, attempting a complete makeover of the organization would be too complicated to achieve any meaningful impact quickly.  \n\nInstead, a data innovation roadmap should identify a sequence of data innovation project focused on advancing the organization's capabilities in a specific domain or in a specific area of the statistical business process.  The roadmap should **target high-potential domains or processes** where:\n\n- There is a clear-cut set of interconnected opportunities to reuse data and technology assets to solve the root cause of systemic problems (e.g., chronic inefficiencies, high variability, and routinely missed opportunities) and to create value to customers, staff and providers\n- Results can be delivered in 6-18 months\n- Sponsors are relatively easy to find and stakeholders' buy-in is easy to secure\n\nBy generating an organic cycle of change within specific domains or processes, it is then possible to build momentum for the use of new methods, technologies and data sources throughout the organization.   Data innovation should be considered an ongoing process rather than a collection of siloed, on-off efforts.\n\n\n\n",

You are going to move a lot of things around before you're finished.)\n> - As you place each object on the mural, discuss what it is and how it relates to other objects. Do you have the right name for the object?  If not, toss the note and write a new one. \n> - Once you have your objects down, move them around to place related objects together.  (It does not have to be perfect. Most first-draft domain models are messy.  Move things around, and talk about them.  You may find that you need an extra object, or realize an existing object is unnecessary.)\n> - Draw a line to connect two of the domain objects.

In SKOS, associative relations are represented via the `skos:related` element.\n\n- **Mapping relations** - Link elements that belong to different semantic models, enabling semantic interoperability between applications that use different semantic models.  In SKOS, mapping relations can be represented via `skos:exactMatch`, `skos:closeMatch`, `skos:broadMatch`, `skos:narrowMatch`, `skos:relatedMatch`.   In OWL mapping relations can be represented via `owl:sameAs`.   *Note: Ensuring quality of interlinking is crucial, as interlinking heterogeneous semantic models is challenging and error-prone.* \n\n- **Instantiation relations**: Link one entity to one or more classes it is an instance of, helping determine its expected characteristics and behavior. In RDF(s) and OWL, instantiation relations are represented via `rdf:type`.\n\n- **Lexicalization relations**: Link a semantic model's element (e.g., an entity, relation, attribute, etc.) to natural-language terms (labels) that express and clarify its meaning. When the same element has multiple lexicalizations, the terms involved are said to by *synonyms* or *lexical variants* of each other.  In RDF(S) and OWL, lexicalization relations are represented via `rdfs:label`. SKOS allows to distinguish between the preferred, alternative and \"hidden\" lexical labels for any given resource using `skos:prefLabel`, `skos:altLabel` and `skos:hiddenLabel`.\n\n- **Definitions and examples**: Describe the meaning of an element in natural language form.   They are usually expressed via `rdfs:comments`, `skos:definition`, `skos:example`.\n  - *Extensional definitions*: Specify every element that falls under the definition.\n  - *Intentional definitoins*: Sepecify necessary and sufficient conditions for using an element.\n  - *Definitions by genus and difference*: State the broad category an element belongs to and then distinguishes it by specific properties.\n  - *Ostensive definitions*: Give the meaning of an element by pointing out examples. \n\n\n\n",

Usually, the chain of events that leads to a catastrophic system failure are not independent from each other:  Sudden shocks and excessive strain may cause a component to fail.  And a failure in one part of the system may in turn cause strain to other parts of the system, increasing the probability of further component failures.\n\nEvery integration point is a potential point of failure propagation.  This is particularly a risk in the context of API-first application development. A **cascading failure** occurs when a crack in one layer triggers a crack in a calling layer. \n\n\"It is impossible to predict and eliminate all possible bad events\". The objective should be to contain the damage from individual failures in order to protect the rest of the system. \n\nBad events are inevitable, but they must be survived. Some ways to mitigate the risk of cascading failures is to introduce timeouts, handshaking and decoupling middleware in all integration points.  \n\n",

In situation where multiple revisions of an estimate are published over time, reliability can be thought of as the closeness of the initial estimate to the subsequent estimated values. \n\n  - *Indicators of reliability may include:*\n    - Sample size relative to population size\n    - Standard deviations \n    - Standard error estimated using a resampling method (e.g., bootstrap or jackknife estimation)\n    - Number and size of subsequent revisions\n\n- **Coherence and comparability:**  Degree to which two data points (or two datasets) can be assumed to be the result of the same overall data generation process, thus allowing to meaningfully combine them for analytic purposes.  In other words, for two data points (or data sets) to be deemed coherent and comparable, the assumptions made about the respective processes that generated them should not stand in contradiction to each other in any significant way.  For statistical data, coherence and comparability require in particular the use of common standards with regard to the concepts, definitions, classifications, and methods employed in their collection, processing, and dissemination.\n\n  - *Indicators of coherence and comparability may include:*\n    - Relative size of discrepancies in spatio-temporal trends exhibitied between two or more datasets that provide the same or similar information on the same subject matter\n    - Whether or not to datasets use the same concepts, definitions, and classifications (e.g., same definition of statistical units; common sampling frameworks; same definition of geographic areas and reference time periods; same temporal frequency and geographic granularity; same definition of age groups; etc.) \n\n- **Timeliness**: Extent to which the statistical information pertaining to the measurement of a past phenomenon or event is delivered in time for users to be take meaningful action or make consequential decisions.\n\n  - *Indicators of timeliness may include:*\n    - Gap between publication date and reference period\n\n- **Punctuality:** Degree to which statistical information is delivered according to an initially announced publication schedule.\n\n  - *Indicators of reliability may include:*\n    - Gap between actual and planned publication dates\n\n- **Completeness**: Degree to which the data set includes all the relevant information expected by the user.\n  - *Indicators of completeness may include:*\n    - Number of records that are missing key variables\n    - Total percentage of empty cells\n    - Proportion of statistical units in the target population that are not represented in the data set\n    - Proportion of statistical units in the sample design for which information is available / Response rates\n\n- **Accessibility:** Ease with which users can find and obtain the statistical data in a ready-to-use format and in line with open data standards.\n\n- **Interoperability**:  Ease with which a data set can be ingested and handled by multiple, independent, standard-compliant data processing and analysis systems. \n  - *Indicators of data security and confidentiality may include:*\n    - Use of standard classifications, concepts and definitions\n    - Use of open, machine-readable data formats and serializations\n\n\n- **Clarity:** Extent to which the statistics are presented to users in an understandable manner and in a form that facilitates its proper interpretation and use. \n  - *Indicators of data security and confidentiality may include:*\n    - Availability of complete and easy-to understand reference metadata (including glossary and methodological notes)\n    - Use of meaningful, human-readable variable names\n\n\n- ** Security and confidentiality:** Effectiveness with which the integrity of the data is preserved and the risks of disclosing confidential information about individuals, households and businesses are mitigated.\n\n- **Compliance with applicable legal requirements**:\n\n\nUser satisfaction surveys are one means to collect data on quality indicators.\n\n**Relationship between dimensions of quality of statistical information:**\n\n- **Accuracy vs reliability**:  When there is a systematic bias in the data production process, then increasing the sample size will generally increase reliability but will not improve accuracy.\n\n\n",

Activities\n   - Product backlog grooming\n   - **Sprint planning**:\n      - At the beginning of each sprint, the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team must jointly determine the subset of product backlog items they believe can completed in the next sprint. They also agree on a sprint goal and commit to deliver a specific set of features, creating a sprint backlog. \"Sprint planning results in both a forecast and a commitment.\"  This commitment helps build trust between the product owner and the development team, supports short-term planning and decision making in the organization, and enables teams to make decisions based on what other teams have committed to.\n   - **Sprint execution**:\n      - The development team, coached by the scrum master, performs all the task-level work specified in the sprint backlog.  Through daily scrum meetings, the team members help mange the flow of work. \n   - **Sprint review**:\n      - Stakeholders and scrum team inspect the product being built in a scheduled meeting, where they inspect the product features just completed and discuss to guide and adapt forthcoming development efforts. It is also an opportunity to get a deeper appreciation of the business side needs and expectations.\n   - **Sprint retrospective**:\n      - After the sprint review, and before the next sprint planning meeting, the scrum team inspects the scrum process being used to create the product. As a result of the retrospective, the team identifies and commits to a practical number of process improvement actions for the next sprint.\n\n3. Artifacts\n   - **Product backlog**\n   - **Sprint backlog**: Features of the product backlog that should be delivered by the end of the current sprint, broken down into more granular tasks, each of which has a detailed description and an effort-hour estimate.  \n\n4. Rules\n  - As a general rule, no changes in scope or personnel are permitted during the sprint\n  - Sprints always have a fixed start and end date, and are generally of the same duration (in order to establish a cadence)\n\n\n",

They decided that \u201cAgile matters more than Scrum\u201d and that \u201cagile principles matter more than specific practices\u201d.  Some of the changes they introduced include:\n\n- Spotify renamed the role of \u201cscrum master\u201d to \u201cagile coach\u201d, emphasizing the need of servant-leaders rather than process masters, and instead of \u201cscrum teams\u201d they refer to their cross-functional, self-organizing teams as \u201cautonomous squads\u201d.  Each squad decides what to build, how to build it, and how to work together, within the limits of the squad\u2019s long-term mission, the product strategy, and short-term goals that are negotiated every quarter.  \n- Squads are loosely coupled but tightly aligned teams.  \u201cAlignment enables autonomy\u201d. The leader\u2019s job is to communicate what problem needs to be solved and why. The squad\u2019s job is to collaborate with each other to find the best solution. \n- Squads are grouped into \u201ctribes\u201d. Each person is simultaneously a member of a squad (product dimension), and a chapter (a competency area) that cuts across multiple squads in a tribe. \n- There are also \u201cguilds\u201d \u2013 or light-weight, company-wide communities of interest where people share knowledge on a specific area (leadership, web development, \u2026) through mailing lists, bi-annual conferences, and other informal communication methods. \n- Cross pollination rather than standardization: Instead of prescribing the use of particular tools, When enough squads use the same tool, that becomes a de-facto standard. This allows for a healthy balance between consistency and flexibility.\n- Internal open-source model. Anyone can edit any code. However, there is a culture of peer code review, which improves quality and promotes knowledge sharing.  \n- Culture of trust and mutual respect. Give credit to each other for great work, and seldom take credit for oneself. Agile at scale requires trust at scale, and that means no politics, and no fear. \n- Focus on speed: Small and frequent releases; investment in test automation and continuous delivery infrastructure. \n- Three types of squads:\n  - Feature squads: Focus on building features in one specific area (e.g., \u2018search\u2019), to be released across all platforms\n  - Client app squads: Focus on making all feature releases on one specific platform easy (e.g., desktop, iOS, Android)\n  - Infrastructure squads: Focus on providing tools and routines that make other squads more effective (e.g., continuous delivery, testing\u2026) \n\n\n",

It emphasizes the elimination of over-burden and the reduction of variability in workflows.  \n\nIt originated as a work scheduling system in lean manufacturing. \n\nIn contrast to scrum, kanban is well suited to manage \"interrupt-driven\" work environments. The idea is to monitor the \"work in process\" (WIP) at each step, ensuring that teams are not doing more work than they have the capacity to do.  \n\nA **kanban board** helps organize work by moving user stories in sequence, from \"to do\", to \"doing\", to \"done\".  Stories at the top of the \"to do\" column have the highest costumer value, and the team works on top stories until they are finished, before moving to next stories.  \n\n- It is important to make sure that there is not too much work under any of the three columns at any given moment. \n- All the work in the board should be self-assigned\n\n\n",

This includes selecting the appropriate mix of on-premises and cloud infrastructure (depending on the type of data inputs and the different analysis and estimation methods that will be used in the project) as well as planning and design to incorporate the right type of data integration patterns (e.g., ETL, data virtualization...), storage strategies, and infrastructure/performance optimizations (e.g., streaming, in-memory, hybrid storage).\n\nThe engineering of data pipelines will need to cover both \"development\" and \"production\" environments, as well as a strategy for testing development operations before pushing them into production. \n\nMoreover, the data architecture should provide for data storage and data processing environments and tools that allow the members of cross-functional teams to collaborate in the development, testing, implementation and refinement of various data estimation methods.\n\nSome key requirements for the data architecture include:\n- Easy to maintain by the organization's own staff\n- Easy to replicate by people outside the project team\n\n\n",

They are optimized for dealing with analytical queries (as opposed to transactional queries). In addition, they are designed for ease of understanding, so analysts can connect their analytic and visualization tools to them without having to invest much time understanding the underlying data structures. \n\nThe term Data Warehouse was coined by William Inmon in 1990, which he defined as \"a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision making process.\"   \n- *Subject Oriented:* Provides information about a particular subject.\n- *Integrated:* Merges data from multiple sources into a coherent whole.\n- *Time-variant:* Each data point refers to a specific time period.\n- *Non-volatile:* Data can be added but data is never removed from the warehouse. \n\n(Source: \"What is a Data Warehouse?\" W.H. Inmon, Prism, Volume 1, Number 1, 1995).\n\nData warehouses can run into problems with large volumnes of data -- they may need to truncate older data and keep only summary tables.  An query performance can be an issue.  Using a data warehouse database as the main interface for data is not optimal for some machine learning tools, since the data must be unloaded from the database before it can be operated on. \n\n",

They are often called during a critical juncture to deal with a specific problem or explore a new opportunity.\n\nA critical success factor is having clearly defined, realistic outputs, timeline, and exit criteria for each phase of the project.  \n\nAd-hoc  cross functional teams are challenged by complex supervisory relationships and incentive structures, as their members formally report to different functional managers. This increases the need for **horizontal cooperation and coordination** among team members.\n\nTo  avoid turf battles and organizational power politics, the different members of an ad-hoc cross-functional team must be completely **focused on creating value to customers**.  Team members must therefore have adequate **incentives to collaborate** outside their own \"home teams\" in the organization.  This means that their performance needs to be measured and rewarded based on their contributions towards achieving the objectives of the cross-functional project.\n\nPutting together the **right mix of talents** is another key ingredient for the success of a cross-functional team.  Reluctance by managers from different functional areas to get personally involved and to commit their most qualified staff to a cross functional project team often leads to poor results. On the other hand, assigning key staff members to a cross-functional project is a clear signal of the commitment by senior management to the success of the project. \n\nAd-hoc cross functional teams must also have a clearly defined **\"sunsetting\" plan** for incorporating back people and the team outputs, innovations and learnings back into the organization's functional processes and structure when the time comes to dissolve the team.  In particular, it is important to identify opportunities for team members to take on new responsibilities based on the skills they developed while being part of the ad-hoc cross functional team.\n\n",

The network of formal and informal cooperative and collaborative relationships and interactions between each of those entities that are critical to the business, including:\n  - Value flows\n  - Information flows\n\nIn addition, an organization map shows:\n\n- Which organization units have which business capabilities (in a many-to-many mapping)\n- Relationships between organization units and geographic location\n\nAn organization map describes an enterprise as a social network, showing how its organizational units, suppliers, partners, customers and other stakeholder groups actually interact and operate across formal boundaries and siloes. \n\nIt includes individual organizational units as well as collaborative teams operating across two or more organizational units. \n\nPurpose of organizational mapping:\n\n1. Improve understanding of how different business units may be impacted by changes in business conditions and the implementation of new systems, applications, data models and infrastructure\n2. Support a holistic approach to strategic planning and investment analysis, showing how an initiative sponsored by one business unit may affect others. \n3. Maximize asset reuse across multiple business units, identifying common requirements and solutions.\n4. Identify which business unites need to communicate and collaborate in order to realize the goals of specific initiatives\n\nThe creation of an organization map is a key step in the development of a business architecture aimed to \"ensure that the real problem is solved\" thorugh changes in business processes, roles and responsibilities and investments in data, applications and IT infrastructure.\n\n",
